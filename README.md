#### a. What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
  I wanted to use MEAN stack for app development, so i chose mongodb. Also there were good resources for nodejs and mongodb.

#### b. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
  Angularjs was easy as I could reuse most of the script from project 1. Also deploying the app on heroku was very simple.

#### c. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
  Using animations in angularjs was a little time consuming. This was new for me and I had to read the documentation.

#### d. If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
  Angularjs is an evolving framework. The libraries that I have used now may become absolete tomorrow, so migration to a newer version would be another project/task.
